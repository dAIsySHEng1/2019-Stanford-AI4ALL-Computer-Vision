    "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of certain lower-level frameworks like Tensorflow. It is one level above Tensorflow and aims at implementing the Deep Learning pipelines easily and quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our final project, we will be using Keras to build the entire pipeline from scratch. This includes data pre-processing, feature extraction (with CNN) and classification (with fully-connected nets). The goal of this tutorial is to give you adequate knowledge to prepare you for the final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is good about Keras compared with other Deep Learning frameworks:\n",
    "* It's high-level, which means that you can implement complex things with several lines of simple code\n",
    "* It works directly with NumPy arrays, so you don't have to spend extra time on creating a Python class for dataset like PyTorch"
